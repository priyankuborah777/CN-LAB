CN Lab – Assignment 2
Objective:
To gain experience of TCP Socket Programming for simple applications.
 
Exercise: 
Write a program using TCP socket to implement the following: 
i. Server maintains records of fruits in the format: fruit-name, quantity Last-sold,

list should be updated in the server every time a transaction occurs.
vi. The total number of unique customers who did some transaction will be 
displayed to the customer every time.
Steps/ Hints: (if any)
