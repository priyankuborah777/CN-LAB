Assignment 13: 
Objective:
To learn packet capturing and analysis.
 
 
Exercise: 
Create a binary tree topology with 7 switches in mininet. Capture packets at the root 
switch. Write a C program to extract the headers and draw a time diagram to show 
the protocols displayed in the captured file (save the .pcap/.pcapng file of 
wireshark/tshark) during a PING operation. List the L2, L3, L4 protocols that can be 
extracted from the .pcap/.pcapng file.
Steps/ Hints: (if any)
1. Create the mininet topology with mn command.
2. Open the root switch with xterm and capture the packets there. Save the 
captured packet in pcap/pcapng file.
3. Draw a time diagram in C showing occurrences of different types of packets with 
time.
4. List the unique types of the packets or the types of protocol from the extracted 
packets.
Learning Outcomes: 
1. Learning to analyze packets and its corresponding protocols.
2. Learning the roles of L2/L3/L4 protocols for a communication.
